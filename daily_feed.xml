      <link>https://www.newagebd.net/post/opinion/285989/politics-of-unequal-memory</link>
      <description>HISTORY has a way of returning not as memory, but as message.

It is the day when the Pakistani military surrendered in Dhaka, sealing Bangladesh’s long-cherished sovereignty. India, which joined......</description>

      <title>Navigating food safety crossroads</title>
      <link>https://www.newagebd.net/post/opinion/285987/navigating-food-safety-crossroads</link>
      <description>ON A humid afternoon in Dhaka, a hawker slices boiled eggs into a steaming bowl of street biryani while a delivery van backs into a restaurant yard stacked with plastic crates.

      <description>HISTORY is a discipline — but we also use the same word to mean the description of past events produced through the methods of that discipline. A historically grounded account rests on evidence, passes through multiple stages of scrutiny and — most importantly — always leaves room for correction. No historical claim is final; it remains open to revision as new evidence emerges or new questions are asked......</description>
