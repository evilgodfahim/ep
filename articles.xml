      <description>LAW is often described as society’s last shelter. Justice is supposed to be the thin line that separates order from chaos, authority from arbitrariness and power from violence. Yet the latest report by the Human Rights Culture Foundation reads less like a legal audit and more like a forensic record of how that shelter has developed cracks large enough for fear to walk......</description>

      <description>The world has stepped into 2026 with a digital tension felt across boardrooms, data centres and living rooms alike. We have never been more connected, yet never more exposed. Cyberattacks no longer feel like distant headlines but like storms already forming on the horizon, capable of sweeping across countries and industries within hours.

      <description>THERE are shortages born of nature and markets, and then there are shortages manufactured by human design. Bangladesh’s ongoing liquefied petroleum gas crisis belongs firmly to the second category. For nearly two weeks, LPG cylinders have vanished from large swathes of the country. Where they are available, a government-fixed price of Tk 1,253 for a 12-kilogram......</description>

They were the result of years of tension, sanctions and political confrontation between Washington and Caracas. For the United States, Maduro has long been viewed not as a legitimate head of state but as the leader of a criminal regime. This......</description>

      <description>WHAT the United States is signalling in Venezuela is not merely a dispute over one government, one election, or one leader. It is a warning to the world that international law — already fragile, already selectively enforced — has now been openly pushed aside. And this warning comes from a man who presents himself as a global peacemaker, a would-be Nobel laureate......</description>

      <description>THE latest figures on border violence by Indian border guards expose an upsetting continuity that renders repeated assurances from New Delhi hollow. Ain O Salish Kendra’s annual rights report says that at least 34 Bangladeshis were killed by India’s Border Security Force in 2025, the highest in five years. Besides, Indians killed at least 12 more along the frontiers in Sylhet......</description>
