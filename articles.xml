      <description>LAW is often described as society’s last shelter. Justice is supposed to be the thin line that separates order from chaos, authority from arbitrariness and power from violence. Yet the latest report by the Human Rights Culture Foundation reads less like a legal audit and more like a forensic record of how that shelter has developed cracks large enough for fear to walk......</description>

For the United States, Maduro has long been viewed not as a legitimate head of state but as the leader of a criminal regime. This......</description>

      <description>WHAT the United States is signalling in Venezuela is not merely a dispute over one government, one election, or one leader. It is a warning to the world that international law — already fragile, already selectively enforced — has now been openly pushed aside. And this warning comes from a man who presents himself as a global peacemaker, a would-be Nobel laureate......</description>

Besides, Indians killed at least 12 more along the frontiers in Sylhet......</description>
