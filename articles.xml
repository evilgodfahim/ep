      <description>THE architecture of global trade is changing faster than most countries can adapt. The era of a single dominant power setting the rules is over. In its place, a complex, multi-centred system, what experts call polycentric trade governance, is emerging. No longer do a few capitals like Washington or Brussels dictate global commerce. Power is now spread across......</description>

      <description>MUCH has been claimed about climate change as a threat multiplier. Yet for many women in Bangladesh — especially in its most vulnerable areas — climate is not just a multiplier; it is a mirror.

It also suggests a lax enforcement of traffic rules and motorcyclists’ proclivity to disregard them.
