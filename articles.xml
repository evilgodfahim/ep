      <description>REVOLUTION- seldom has a word in the English lexicon stirred such conflicting emotions and ignited initial adulation and subsequent detraction in equal measure. The term has been romanticised, idolised, glamorized, sensitized, sanitized, duplicated, replicated, examined, analysed, criticised, rejected and re-evaluated. Change in times, change in material and spiritual......</description>

      <link>https://www.newagebd.net/post/opinion/289438/peace-as-practice-not-pause</link>
      <description>PEACE is often mistaken for a passive condition — the silence between conflicts, or the mere absence of open violence. This understanding is not only shallow but dangerous. Peace is not inertia; it is labour. It is an active and sustained social practice. As the Seville Statement on Violence made clear decades ago, peace is not biologically ordained but socially constructed......</description>

      <description>INTERNATIONAL days often pass with speeches, slogans and well-meaning declarations. What matters more is what remains once the banners come down. The recent global focus on clean energy offers such a moment of reckoning. Beyond the symbolism, it forces a harder question for countries like Bangladesh: are we genuinely transitioning towards clean energy......</description>

      <description>AN ENERGY transition has once again been exposed as more rhetorical, with civil society warning that a crucial window for reform has been allowed to pass without action. At the centre of the criticism is the interim government’s failure to lay even a preliminary foundation for shifting the energy system away from fossil fuel dependence towards renewable sources......</description>

      <description>BUREAUCRATIC control, resulting in widespread corruption, declining public services and uneven development, was the primary public grievance that sparked off the July uprising, driven by the hope of breaking free from this cycle of the abuse of power. But, the interim government which assumed office with the mandate to effect institutional reforms has largely remained......</description>
