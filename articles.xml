      <link>https://www.newagebd.net/post/opinion/286761/memory-of-a-handshake</link>
      <description>THERE are moments in a person’s life that are neither formal events nor recorded chapters of history, yet they settle permanently in the hidden chambers of memory.

      <description>WHEN Begum Khaleda Zia died on December 30, 2025, Bangladesh did not only lose a former prime minister; it lost a presence that many women had quietly carried with them for decades. She was not born into a political dynasty, nor did she enter public life as a polished insider trained for power. Her political journey emerged from the upheavals of Bangladesh’s......</description>
