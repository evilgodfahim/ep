      <description>PEACE is often mistaken for a passive condition — the silence between conflicts, or the mere absence of open violence. This understanding is not only shallow but dangerous. Peace is not inertia; it is labour. It is an active and sustained social practice. As the Seville Statement on Violence made clear decades ago, peace is not biologically ordained but socially constructed......</description>

      <description>AN ENERGY transition has once again been exposed as more rhetorical, with civil society warning that a crucial window for reform has been allowed to pass without action. At the centre of the criticism is the interim government’s failure to lay even a preliminary foundation for shifting the energy system away from fossil fuel dependence towards renewable sources......</description>

But, the interim government which assumed office with the mandate to effect institutional reforms has largely remained......</description>
